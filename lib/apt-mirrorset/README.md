### Mirrors

With Ubuntu, each mirror has a complete copy of the entire archive. This is the only way to do it when all the distributions share a single `pool` at the archive level.

Well actually... Mirrors are at the dist level, even though artifacts are shared among dists in an archive.

a helper library for comparing different mirrors of the same Apt repo.  However, mirroring is somewhat less standardized.
